This plugin allows you to easily 'pin' posts, pages and custom post types. When you pin a post a shortcut link appears in the post menu so that you can easily edit the post. Use this plugin if you constantly find yourself editing the same posts and you are sick of showing the list of posts, then find the post you want and then click edit. Now you just click the post shortcut in the menu and edit.
